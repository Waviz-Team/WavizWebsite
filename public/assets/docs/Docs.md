# Introduction

Waviz is a modern, modular React library for audio and signal visualization. Designed to fill the gap left by outdated or deprecated alternatives, Waviz helps developers build beautiful, customizable sound visualizations with ease.

## Overview

Waviz provides Plug-and-Play React components for audio visualization, including waveform and bar visualizers. Whether you’re building a music player, educational app, or audio signal monitor, Waviz gives you the tools to integrate dynamic visuals quickly and cleanly.

For developers who want more control, Waviz Core provides low-level access to the underlying architecture—allowing you to build custom visualizations and components tailored to your specific needs.

## Architecture

Waviz uses a modular architecture with single-responsibility function nodes:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Built for composability

# Installation

Waviz is available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waviz) using:

```
npm i waviz
```

## Library

Waviz has two primary libraries:

- [Waviz Core](#waviz-core)
- [Plug n Play](#plug--play-react-components)

![Waviz Library](/assets/docs/assets/WavizLibraries.png)

If you want a simple plug-in and to use React Components, go to our [Plug-n-Play React Components section](#plug--play-react-components). Plug-n-Play uses the Waviz Core Library to generate presets.

If you want to have more control over what you build, go to our [Waviz Core Section](#waviz-core). Waviz Core uses Web Audio API and HTML Canvas to generate a visualizer.

### Waviz Core

Waviz Core has 3 primitive classes:

- [Input](#input-class)
- [Analyzer](#analyzer-class)
- [Visualizer](#visualizer-class)

While they are designed to work together, each of these classes can be used independently. The basic flow of data is: Input -> Analyzer -> Visualizer.

![coreStructure](/assets/docs/assets/CoreStructure.png)

If you want to use all three classes in tandem, we have a composition class 'Waviz' that you can initialize.

#### Waviz Class

The Waviz class is the 'wrapper' class that uses all three primitive classes to initialize a visualizer. This is the recommended class to get started if you are using the Core Library.

The Waviz class takes in three arguments:

- HTML Canvas element
- Audio Source
- Audio Context

While all three arguments are optional, an Audio Source and a HTMLCanvas are the bare minimum needed to initialize a visualizer. The Audio Source argument should only be passed in if you have already established an AudioContext.

To get started, initialize the waviz class by passing in an Audio Source and a HTML Canvas element:

```ts
const myWaviz = new Waviz(canvas, audio);
```

From here, you can call your visualizer within a relevant event listener. Due to browser protection policies, you cannot initialize a visualizer without tying it to a user gesture.

```ts
myWaviz.visualizer.simpleBars();
```

If you are using a media stream element (microphone, tab audio, etc), you need to also initialize the pending method. This will ensure that the visualizer waits for user permissions before continuing forward. It is recommended that regardless of what input element you are using, you always initialize pending. This will be an async call, so make sure you call this within an asynchronous function.

```ts
await myWaviz.input.initializePending();
```

The recommended initialization should look like so:

```tsx
const myWaviz = new Waviz(canvas, audio);

audio.addEventListener('play', async () => {
  await myWaviz.input.initializePending();
  myWaviz.visualizer.simpleBars();
});

audio.addEventListener('pause', () => {
  myWaviz.visualizer.stop();
});
```

#### Input Class

The Input class handles the 'preparation' of the audio inputs you would like to use. It takes in a callback function (to initialize source nodes) and an optional AudioContext. The current supported inputs are:

- HTML Audio elements
- HTML Video elements
- Local File inputs
- URL/path strings to media files
- Microphone (defined by 'microphone')
- Tab Audio (defined by 'screenAudio')

An example initialization of the input class will look like such:

```ts
const input = new Input((sourceNode) => {
  // Setup your analyzer or other logic here
  analyzer.startAnalysis(audioContext, sourceNode);
}, audioContext);
```

Refer to our [website](https://wavizjs.com) for more detailed information on the different inputs, methods, and handling.

#### Analyzer Class

The Analyzer class is the primary handler for transforming an input into readable frequency data. The analyzer class does not take in any arguments; however, it needs to be initiated via the 'startAnalysis' method - a function that takes in an AudioContext and a sourceNode.

```ts
const testAnalyzer = new AudioAnalyzer();
testAnalyzer.startAnalysis(audioContext, sourceNode);
```

Once an analysis has been started, you can grab the frequency domain data or time domain data using the getFrequencyData and getTimeDomainData methods.

```ts
const frequencyData = analyzer.getFrequencyData();
const timeDomainData = analyzer.getTimeDomainData();
```

### Visualizer Class

The visualizer class is the engine of our visualization. It draws 2d visualizations by taking in a HTML Canvas Element and a Uint8Array (or our audioAnalyzer instance).

**Key Features:**

- Supports multiple visualization types: lines, bars, dots, particles, and more
- Works with both time and frequency domain data
- Customizable colors, gradients, and styles

**Basic Usage:**

```ts
import { Waviz } from 'waviz';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const audio = document.getElementById('audio');

const myWaviz = new Waviz(canvas, audio);

audio.addEventListener('play', async () => {
  myWaviz.simpleLine('#3498db'); // Draws a simple blue waveform line
});
```

For more advanced options and layering, see the [Visualizer Documentation](doc/VisualizerDocs.md).

## Plug & Play React Components

Waviz offers easy-to-use, plug-and-play React components for rapid integration of audio visualizations into your React applications.

**Key Features:**

- Simple React props API—just provide an audio source and (optionally) a canvas ref
- Supports multiple visualization types and presets
- Fully compatible with React functional components and hooks

**Basic Usage:**

To use, make sure you establish a useRef( ) for the audio. The canvas useRef ( ) can be optional but for the most control over the size, it is recommended that you create a canvas that will be passed down.

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Mixed3 } from 'waviz';

export default function App() {
  const audioRef = useRef<HTMLAudioElement>(null);
  const canvasRef = useRef<HTMLCanvasElement>(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <Mixed3 srcAudio={audioRef} srcCanvas={canvasRef} />
      <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={400} height={400}></canvas>
      <audio ref={audioRef} src='/your-audio-file.mp3' controls />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Just like from the Input class, you can also initialize the visualizer using mediaStream inputs instead. You would set the useRef directly at the top instead of assigning it to the audio.

```ts
const audioRef = useRef('screenAudio');
```

**Available Components:**

- `Bars` - 6 different presets of Bar visualization
- `Waves` - 7 different presets of Wave visualization
- `Dots` - 4 different presets of Dots visualization
- `Particles` - 1 preset using Particle visualization
- `Mixed` – 11 mixed presets of different visualizations

More component presets will be added in the future! Each component is organized via a number system. For instance for Dots, the imports for each would be as such:

```tsx
import { Dots1 } from 'waviz';
import { Dots2 } from 'waviz';
import { Dots3 } from 'waviz';
import { Dots4 } from 'waviz';
```
